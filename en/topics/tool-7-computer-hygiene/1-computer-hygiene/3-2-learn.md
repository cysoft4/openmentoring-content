title: Keeping your software up to date

It is critical to always update your computer’s software regularly and ensure that you have the latest version available. Keeping your software up to date limits weaknesses in the software that can be exploited by malware.
<br>
Always keep your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc) updated by downloading the latest updates from the respective websites.
<br>
Application software (Word, Excel, LibreOffice), either bought or open source, should also be kept up to date. Set your software to send you alerts about security updates, if such an option is available, so that you can get them as soon as they are released.
<br>
Most software on Windows will either update automatically or alert you to available updates, and point you to where you can download them. Windows operating system is set to auto-update by default.
<br>
If your settings are not set to auto-update (mobile-based GSM data providers often advise you to turn off automatic Windows updates to conserve your data bundles) you can turn this function on by going to your computer’s Start menu, selecting All Programs and clicking Windows Update.
<br>
Alternatively, through the process above you can set Windows Update to inform you of available updates and let you decide whether to download them or not. This way, you can download and install all your updates when you are in a place with a good and affordable internet connection (e.g. your office)
