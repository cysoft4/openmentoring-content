To start, it is important to know that there are many reasons why your website can be down. Most often this is due to programming errors or technical problems at the company that hosts the site.
<br>
Sometimes, other things like legal challenges can cause a host to turn a site off as well. Before you conclude you are the victim of a DDOS attack, make sure to root out potential problems by speaking with someone in charge of your website.
<br>
Talk to someone in charge of your website. If you don't have someone, read the lesson on [other reasons your site may be down](en/topics/understand-1-how-it-works/5-down-site/1-1-intro.md).
