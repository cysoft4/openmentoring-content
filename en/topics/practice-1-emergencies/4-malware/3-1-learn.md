Malware exploits access to your device to send out spam, seize banking, email or social media credentials, shut down websites and collect vital information from journalists, human rights defenders, NGOs, activists and bloggers.
<br>
Malware works by installing itself on your device when you open a link to a malicious website or open an infected file you have downloaded. After it is installed on your device, it can record keystrokes, steal passwords, take screenshots, record audio, video and more.
<br>
Malware is dangerous software that allows an unauthorized takeover of your device by another user. It can be used by the government or a third party to surveil you.
<br>
While most malware is designed for and utilized by criminals, people working directly or indirectly for governments have increasingly adopted malware as a tool for surveillance, espionage and sabotage.
<br>
With malware, the important thing you can do is prepare. Refer to the [Planning and Preparing](en/topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) unit to learn more about computer hygiene and developing emergency plans.
