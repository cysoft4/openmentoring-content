# 1. Malicious attachment or link
You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious. Links or attachments are often the cause of malware infections.
<br>
2. Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam. This may indicate your device is being accessed remotely.
<br>
3. Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password. This may indicate someone has control of your device.
<br>
4. Your device was seized and then returned. It is possible that your device may have been infected with malware when it was taken from you.
<br>
5. Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device. This may indicate that your device was infected with malware during the break in.

6. Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer. This may indicate that someone has access to your computer.
<br>
7. Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities.

If your device shows clear indicators of compromise and you have also determined that you are not the victim of [account hijacking](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-1-intro.md), you can either 'let the attack play out' or 'clean' your device.
