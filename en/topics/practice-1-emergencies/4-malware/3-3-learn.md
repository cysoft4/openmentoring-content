This term, 'indicators of compromise,' may include the following:
<br>
You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious
<br>
Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam
<br>
Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password
<br>
Your device was seized and then returned
<br>
Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device
<br>
Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer
<br>
Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities
<br>
If you have answered 'yes' to any of these questions to determine there are clear indicators of compromise and also confirming that you are not victim to an account hijacking, you can do two things: 1) clean your devices, or 2) understand the attack and then clean your devices.
