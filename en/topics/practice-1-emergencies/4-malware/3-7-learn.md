Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be more important than 'cleaning' your computer.

It can be very valuable and empowering to gain understanding of your adversary through letting the attack play out.

If understanding the attacker and the attack is important to you, you must collect and analyse information when a potential malware infection happens. Do this before ‘cleaning’ your computer.
> bring in more from umbrella counter surveillance - physical. impliactions of counter surveillance...big investment. not easy.
make a simple statement about overt and covert surveillance - benefits and risks of doing both .
1. don't reveal by electornic communications or physical behaviour you think you're being watched
2. move activities to a safe computer - direct to seeking help.
3. work on a strategy on dealing with this, knowing that it can be taken....doing this might be perceived as an escalation. weigh pros and cons - direct people to risk analysis
