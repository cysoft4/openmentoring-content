After an emergency has happened, it's a good time to go back to your emergency and security plans to see what worked and what did not.
<br>
When necessary, this would be a good time to try to improve your organisational procedures (e.g. procedures when on a mission or when organising a training.), determining the best practice of how to respond to an emergency or not.
<br>
This should be considered for all stages of an event or activity - in terms of preparation the implementation of an activity, and when an activity has ended.
<br>
For more information on what to do after an emergency has happened, you might find Protection International's [Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders](https://protectioninternational.org/publications-protection-manual-for-human-rights-defenders/) useful.

##Emergency funding
Some organisations offer funding to individuals or organisations who have encountered an emergency as a result of their journlaism or human rights related work.
<br>
If you are in need of emergency funding, consider reaching out to [Frontline Defenders](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en), [Digital Defenders Partnership](https://www.digitaldefenders.org/), [Reporters without Borders](https://rsf.org/en), the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/), or [Pen International](www.pen-international.org/).

##Traumatic Stress
Traumatic Stress is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. It's very possible that after an emergency, you or your colleagues may be suffering from traumatic stress.
<br>
To learn about what traumatic stress is, how traumatic stress affects you, and how to deal with traumatic stress, refer to the [Your Well-Being](en/topics/understand-2-security/2-your-well-being/index.html) unit presented elsewhere in this tool.
