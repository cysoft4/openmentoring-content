Now is a good time to go back to your emergency and security plans to see what worked and what did not.
<br>
When necessary, this would be a good time to try to improve your organisational procedures (e.g. procedures when on a mission or when organising a training.), determining the best practice of how to respond to an emergency or not.
<br>
This should be considered for all stages of an event or activity - in terms of preparation the implementation of an activity, and when an activity has ended.
<br>
For more information on what to do after an emergency has happened, you might find Protection International's [Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders](https://protectioninternational.org/publications-protection-manual-for-human-rights-defenders/) useful.
