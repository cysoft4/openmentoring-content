Journalists and human rights defenders do difficult and challenging work, and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times.
<br>
It is therefore important to know how to react following a traumatic event, and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress.
<br>
Traumatic Stress is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. It's very possible that after an emergency, you or your colleagues may be suffering from traumatic stress.

To learn about what traumatic stress is, how traumatic stress affects you, and how to deal with traumatic stress, refer to the [Your Well-Being](en/topics/understand-2-security/2-your-well-being/index.html) unit presented elsewhere in this tool.
