Think about the kinds of security protections the device had in place:
<br>
- Was the device protected by a password or other security measures?
<br>
- Which operating system was running on the device? Was this a legal version, or was it an illegal, jailbroken or rooted version?
<br>
- Does the device have full disk encryption turned on?
<br>
- What state was your device in when it was lost? Were you logged in? Was the device on but password-locked? Was it sleeping or hibernating? Completely turned off?
<br>
- Do you have remote access to the device?
