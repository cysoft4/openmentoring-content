Should you believe your device is seized, start by answering some simple questions:
<br>
- What happened?
<br>
- What sort of device are you missing? A computer, mobile phone, tablet or an external hard drive?
<br>
- When and where did you lose the device?
<br>
- How did you lose the device? Was it stolen by another person, taken by a state authority or did you simply lose track of it?
<br>
-Is the device still missing?
