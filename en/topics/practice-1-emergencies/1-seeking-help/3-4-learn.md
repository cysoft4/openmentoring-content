When you are seeking remote help from a third party please keep the following in mind:
- If you think there is something wrong with one of your devices or accounts and you are uncomfortable or unsure about what to do next, ask for help from a trained technical professional or (inter)national organizations (some listed below) whom you feel you can trust.
<br>
- Remember that the device you are using might be the subject of the attack.
<br>
- In order to establish a secure line of communication with a person who can help you, it may be necessary to contact them from an alternate, trustworthy device.
<br>
- The guides referenced in the [Next Steps](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/1-seeking-help/7-next.md) section can also help.
<br>
- If possible, do not rely on unknown people you find online.
