Secure communication is always a trade-off between security and convenience. 
<br>
Choosing the most appropriate form of secure communication will depend on your unique situation, your threat model and the activities in which you are involved.
<br>
When communicating there are different levels of security. This section focuses on protecting the identity of your communication participants. You can read more about what to do if you are under [targeted threat](5-learn-targeted.md).

Anonymisation tools hide the sender and recipient of a message and will protect the identity of the participants in a communication.

Examples of anonymisation tools are [tor](en/topics/tool-4-tor/0-getting-started/index.md), or [orbot](en/topics/tool-5-orbot/0-getting-started/index.md) on your phone.
