For some platforms (e.g. Facebook, Gmail), it is possible to review connection history and account activity. This will let you know if your account has been accessed by someone else.
<br>
Check to see if your account was accessed at a time when you were not online or if your account was accessed from an unfamiliar location or IP address.
<br>
Be mindful that if you are using the Tor browser or a VPN service, it is possible that the location or IP address may differ from the location you have accessed the platform.
