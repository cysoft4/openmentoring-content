## If your website is defaced
Step 1: Verify that this is a malicious takeover of your website. An unfortunate but legal practice is to buy recently expired domain names to ‘take over’ the traffic they had for advertising purposes.
<br>
To prevent this, it is very important to keep payments for your domain name in order.
<br>
Step 2: If your website has been defaced, first regain control of your website login account and reset its password, see the [Account Hijacking]() section for help.
<br>
Step 3: Make a backup of the defaced site that can later be used for investigation of the defacement.
<br>
Step 4: Temporarily turn off your website – use a simple landing page or ‘parked’ page.
<br>
Step 5: Determine how your site was hacked. Your hosting provider may be able to help.
<br>
Common problems are older parts of your site with custom scripts/tools running on them, out of date content management systems, and custom programming with security flaws.
<br>
Step 6: Restore your original from backups. If neither you, nor your hosting company have backups, you may have to re-build your website from scratch!
<br>
Also note that if your only backups are at your hosting provider, an attacker may be able to delete those when they take control of your site!
<br>
Step 7: Move to a DDoS Mitigtion service or secure hosting provider. Deflect.ca can support you in protecting your site from online attacks. CloudFlare can also block many common attacks.
<br>
Secure hosting providers such as VirtualRoad/Qurium go to great lengths to detect and prevent such attacks.
