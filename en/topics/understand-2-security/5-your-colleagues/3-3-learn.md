title: Talking about security with your colleagues

Talking about security is courageous. Failing to talk about security, or or pretending risks do not exist, promotes a culture of carelessness.
<br>
Sometimes, though, it can be hard to talk about security with your colleagues.
<br>
You might face opposition from those who feel talking about security takes away valuable time you could spend doing your jobs. Your colleagues might even put on a brave face and pretending these risks do not exist.
<br>
It's also possible you might feel this way yourself.
<br>
When you or other people bring it up, it is important not to take this as a weakness or a worry, but as an opportunity to develop and make sure everyone is on the same page.
<br>
