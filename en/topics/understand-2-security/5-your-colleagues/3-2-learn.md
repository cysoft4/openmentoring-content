title: Sharing of information with your teams

---
It's important to think about what kinds of information you share with your colleagues and what information to keep private.
<br>
Sharing information with your colleagues about your sources and research means that they will be able to continue your important investigations should something unexpected arise.
<br>
On the other hand, sharing information only on a 'need to know' basis means you might be better able to prevent infiltration by adversaries.
<br>
Whether you share much or little information with your colleagues, it is important that all information shared is done so securely.
<br>
Refer to the [Secure Communications](en/topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications/1-1-intro.md) and [Operational Security](en/topics/understand-3-opsec/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) lessons to learn how to do do so.
