Your security and well being are always more important than a story. To minimise potential risks, it is important to prepare a security assessment before taking on a potentially dangerous story.
<br>
>Step 1
# Identify known hazards

Identify contact people and the time and means of communication; describe all known hazards, including the history of problems in the reporting area; and outline contingency plans that address the perceived risks.
<br>
>Step 2
# Consult diverse sources

Consult diverse sources including journalists with experience in the location or topic, diplomatic advisories, reports on press freedom and human rights, and academic research.
<br>
>Step 3
#Get input from editors

Editors working with staffers or freelancers should have substantial input into the assessment, take the initiative in raising security questions, and receive a copy of the assessment.
<br>
An independent journalist working without a relationship with a news organization must be especially rigorous in compiling a security assessment, consulting with peers,[researching the risks](en/topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-intro.md), and arranging a contact network.
