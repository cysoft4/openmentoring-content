Any person whose work exposes them to many stories and pictures of traumatic events is at an increased risk of indirect exposure to traumatic stress. This includes psychologists, counselors, journalists, nurses, paramedics, as well as police officers and other emergency personnel.

The emotional risk is two-pronged: burnout and vicarious traumatization.

# Burnout
Burnout refers to long-term exhaustion caused by working too hard, for too long, and without sufficient support. It has been linked to a range of emotional and physical health problems, as well as poor performance in the workplace. While exposure to threats or trauma is not a necessary feature of burnout, more emotionally demanding responsibilities place workers at greater risk.

The prevention of burnout requires a two-part strategy. First, organizations must ensure a healthy work environment; appropriate levels of training, supervision, and support; reachable expectations and targets; as well as regular vacation time. Second, individuals should educate themselves as to the risk of burnout, monitor their own emotional health, and actively sustain their own emotional health. The prevention of burnout is a shared responsibility between employer and employee.

When an employee is suffering from burnout (that is, when prevention has failed), the key to recovery is rest. It is essential that the employee take time away from work to recover their emotional health. During this period, it is important to examine and redesign the work situation that led to the problem in the first place. In addition, stress management training might help prevent future recurrence.

# Vicarious Traumatization

Vicarious traumatization refers to traumatic stress arising from exposure to the frightening experiences of others. (Other labels are sometimes applied to this condition, including secondary traumatic stress and compassion fatigue. While not identical, these different labels represent different conceptual approaches to the same underlying problem). In most cases, vicarious traumatization shares the features of the traumatic stress reaction. Sufferers may experience intrusive thoughts and worries relating to the stories that they have heard or may avoid those aspects of their work that involve exposure to the fear and distress of others. People suffering vicarious traumatization may become anxious and irritable or isolate themselves from others. In some cases, vicarious traumatization takes the form of a loss of faith in the essential goodness of others and a growing sense that oneâ€™s work is meaningless. The prevention of vicarious traumatization requires limiting exposure to distressing stories or increasing the capacity to process traumatic material. While the former may be difficult for many people due to the demands of their jobs, regular supervision and ongoing support is helpful for the latter.

When a worker is suffering from vicarious traumatization (that is, prevention has failed), counseling is indicated. People suffering from vicarious traumatization need an opportunity to process the traumatic material that is affecting them. They need to work out which aspects of the stories are upsetting to them and why. When people with vicarious trauma take time off work without first receiving some counseling, they waste their time away from work trying and failing to sort out the upsetting thoughts and feelings on their own. They do not resolve the vicarious trauma, and they do not rest.
