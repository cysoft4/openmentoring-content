Everyone has natural ways of coping. Encourage people to use their own positive coping strategies. This will help them feel stronger and regain a sense of control.
<br>
Adapt the following suggestions to take account of the person and what is possible after the crisis.
<br>
# Encourage positive coping strategies
- Get enough rest
- Eat as regularly as possible and drink water
- Talk and spend time with family and friends.
<br>
- Discuss problems with someone you trust.
- Do activities that help you relax (walk, sing, pray, play with children).
- Do physical exercise
- Find safe ways to help others in the crisis and get involved in community activities.
<br>
# Discourage negative coping strategies
- Don’t take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol
- Don’t sleep all day
- Don’t work all the time without any rest or relation
<br>
- Don't isolate yourself from friends and loved ones.
- Don’t neglect basic personal hygiene
- Don’t be violent
<br>
# Weeks and months after
Keep an eye out for changes in personal attitude (depression, frustration, etc.) as these may be signs of longer-term [post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)](en/topics/understand-2-security/2-your-well-being/3-7-learn.md).
