##Dealing with it
It is normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these will improve naturally over a few weeks.
<br>
However you should visit your doctor if you are still having problems about for weeks after the traumatic experience, of if the symptoms are particularly troublesome. 
<br>
Your doctor may refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you would benefit from this treatment.
<br>
PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how soon they occur after the traumatic event.
<br>
Any of the following treatment options may be recommended:
<br>
- Watchful waiting — waiting to see whether the symptoms improve without treatment
- Psychological treatment — such as psychotherapy or trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CPT)
- Antidepressant medication
