Social networking sites ask you for a good deal of data about yourself to make it easier for other users to find and connect to you.
<br>
Perhaps the biggest vulnerability this creates for users of these sites is the possibility of identity fraud, which is increasingly common.
<br>
The more information about yourself you reveal online, the easier it becomes for the authorities to identify you and monitor your activities.
<br>
The online activities of diaspora activists from some countries have led to the targeting of their family members by the authorities in their homelands.
<br>
Before posting, think about whether it's necessary to post:
 - birth dates
 - contact phone numbers
 - addresses
<br>
 - details of family members
 - sexual orientation
 - education and employment history
